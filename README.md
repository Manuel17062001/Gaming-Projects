- In my opinion this project can reach its potential in the near future because it teaches you how to handle things in your computer with a better organization and without the need of using mouse. 
- This week I was able to learn that there will always be something with your computer that you didnâ€™t know about. I learned that there will always be the need to improvise to be able to avoid some problems and that by knowing how to use all these functions in your computer, you can be prepared for a failure in a crucial moment.


During this week of Semana Tec, I took the class of computational tools, with it I found out what is the terminal and what it is purpose. Further on I learnt how to use the terminal and just how useful i$
After a couple of days of understanding and learning I got the opportunity to work on the terminal and learn how to modify and work on files at the same time through github. I think that even though it w$
Working through github and with the terminal I could conclude that this are very useful skills going towards the future. Computers and progamming are what await us in the future, it is were the world
is going towards next. Learning how to work with computers is one of the most important skills that one can have today. Even though it was a very short time I really enjoyed my time in this class in
which I got to learn a new skill. Getting to work as if I was in google docs or in another collaborative platform but this time working through a terminal really helped me enhance my understanding of
how useful learning a set of computational skills is.



The purpose of this project is to understand the importance of international standards in programming. 
Here we learned about the importance of keeping international standards within coding to make work more effective overall. 
If there are complications programms like Github and bash make it easier to understand the changes made.
