The purpose of this project is to understand the importance of international standards in programming. 
Here we learned about the importance of keeping international standards within coding to make work more effective overall. 
If there are complications programms like Github and bash make it easier to understand the changes made, the reason they were made but most importantly, it makes easier to detect what to improve as a team.
