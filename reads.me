During this week of Semana Tec, I took the class of computational tools, with it I found out what is the terminal and what it is purpose. Further on I learnt how to use the terminal and just how useful it is.
After a couple of days of understanding and learning I got the opportunity to work on the terminal and learn how to modify and work on files at the same time through github. I think that even though it was only a week that we worked on for this class, I got to understand its utility
Working through github and with the terminal I could conclude that this are very useful skills going towards the future. Computers and progamming are what await us in the future, it is were the world
is going towards next. Learning how to work with computers is one of the most important skills that one can have today. Even though it was a very short time I really enjoyed my time in this class in 	
which I got to learn a new skill.
